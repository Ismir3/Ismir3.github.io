          <p>Hi there! So let me tell/write you my story... As already mentioned, I have a degree in Economics and am an aspiring web and app developer. But... lets start from the very beginning... I was born and raised in Zenica, Bosnia (back then ex Yugoslavia) in 03.02.1984 (damn I'm old :P)... so, feel free to buy me something on that date, I wouldn't mind at all :P ... Anyway, even in kindergarten, I was kind of an artist, drawing and painting like nobody else there, and continued to be and do that in elementary school as well, where I collected some awards for best drawings too, appearing in news papers and... stuff... I was good in mathematics too (but I am not very good at memorising lectures)... ok, so later, I finished high school (for an architect), but instead of proceeding in that direction, I enrolled and graduated from the Faculty of Economics. After that, I volunteered in the Tax Office for a year and, while searching for a job in my profession, worked all kinds of part-time jobs, from which I would single out work with children in the basketball club (for which I started to work on the website, but I did not finish because of ended relationships with them). That was a fun job, because I love to work/play with children (maybe because of that child in me), and not once have I heard from someone that I would be a great father one day (I do hope so...). I love animals too (maybe I'm destined to work in ZOO one day.. who knows...).</p> 

          <p>In addition to these jobs, I've completed a lot of courses, live and online, like english courses, basics in web and app development, SolidWorks 3D modeling, Photo editing, some game development... to round up, I am well versed in the basics of the aformentioned fields, but I'm definitely interested in learning some more...</p>

          <p>Anyway, due to lack of work/jobs in the profession, I completed the training for "a responsible person" in the field of protection/security, and for a year now I work as a Security Guard (currently in local Agency - <strong>Sector Security</strong>).  </p>
          
          <p>I will continue to work on this web site/blog, but for now, (pretty) please follow me on Facebook and/or LinkedIn and
            tell your family and friends about it (or else...). If you want to get in touch,
            please click on the contact link in the navigation bar. (or <a href="mailto:ismir.mlinaric@gmail.com">here</a>, if you're too lazy to get up there again :)) And, preferably, offer me a better job, maybe :)</p>
